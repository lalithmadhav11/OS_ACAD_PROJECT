log_event :
// WHY ?
this is used to trace the synchronistaion process

// PARAMS EXPLAINIG :
role->student or faqculty
why const ? to make sure string doesnt get modified inside the function.
msg -> it tell ys what is being done to role ex : needs help, sits on chair.
id -> for student its form 0 till max_st8udents-1 ; -1 means its faculty.

// LOGIC :
time_t ->a datatype for stoirng time 
       -> it will store time in seconds since Jan 1 1970
time(NULL) -> return the current system time

struct tm *t=localtime(&now):
    -> converts raw time into a human readable time 
    -> struct tm has tm_hours,tm_min,tm_sec
    -> localtime(&now)-> now means current time it will be converted to local timezone FormData.

simulate_work :
// WHY?
it stimualtes delay when -> student doing programming needs help
                         -> faculty helping student
// LOGIC :
random becasue :
        students won’t all ask for help at the same time, and faculty helps for random durations.
        just like a real operating system’s scheduling. 

print_queue :

// WHY ?
to display current waiting students.
